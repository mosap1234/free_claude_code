# Greptile / automated review hints

See [docs/architecture/python314-style.md](../docs/architecture/python314-style.md) and [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md): **Python 3.14 comma multi-exception** clauses (`except A, B:`) are intentional; do not suggest parenthesizing them as mandatory syntax fixes.

Do **not** suggest **`# pragma: no cover`** for coverage—the repo forbids it (CI + AGENTS).
