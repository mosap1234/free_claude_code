# AGENTIC DIRECTIVE

> This file is identical to CLAUDE.md. Keep them in sync.

## CODING ENVIRONMENT

- Install astral uv using "curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh" if not already installed and if already installed then update it to the latest version
- Install Python 3.14 using `uv python install 3.14` if not already installed
- Always use `uv run` to run files instead of the global `python` command.
- Current uv ruff formatter is set to py314 which has supports multiple exception types without paranthesis (except TypeError, ValueError:)
- Read `.env.example` for environment variables.
- All CI checks must pass; failing checks block merge.
- Add tests for new changes (including edge cases), then run `uv run pytest`.
- Run checks in this order: `uv run ruff format`, `uv run ruff check`, `uv run ty check`, `uv run pytest`.
- Do not add `# type: ignore` or `# ty: ignore`; fix the underlying type issue.
- All 5 checks are enforced in `tests.yml` on push/merge.

## IDENTITY & CONTEXT

- You are an expert Software Architect and Systems Engineer.
- Goal: Zero-defect, root-cause-oriented engineering for bugs; test-driven engineering for new features. Think carefully; no need to rush.
- Code: Write the simplest code possible. Keep the codebase minimal and modular.

## ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES (see PLAN.md)

- **Shared utilities**: Put shared Anthropic protocol logic in neutral `core/anthropic/` modules. Do not have one provider import from another provider's utils.
- **DRY**: Extract shared base classes to eliminate duplication. Prefer composition over copy-paste.
- **Encapsulation**: Use accessor methods for internal state (e.g. `set_current_task()`), not direct `_attribute` assignment from outside.
- **Provider-specific config**: Keep provider-specific fields (e.g. `nim_settings`) in provider constructors, not in the base `ProviderConfig`.
- **Dead code**: Remove unused code, legacy systems, and hardcoded values. Use settings/config instead of literals (e.g. `settings.provider_type` not `"nvidia_nim"`).
- **Performance**: Use list accumulation for strings (not `+=` in loops), cache env vars at init, prefer iterative over recursive when stack depth matters.
- **Platform-agnostic naming**: Use generic names (e.g. `PLATFORM_EDIT`) not platform-specific ones (e.g. `TELEGRAM_EDIT`) in shared code.
- **No type ignores**: Do not add `# type: ignore` or `# ty: ignore`. Fix the underlying type issue.
- **Complete migrations**: When moving modules, update imports to the new owner and remove old compatibility shims in the same change unless preserving a published interface is explicitly required.
- **Maximum Test Coverage**: There should be maximum test coverage for everything, preferably live smoke test coverage to catch bugs early

## COGNITIVE WORKFLOW

1. **ANALYZE**: Read relevant files. Do not guess.
2. **PLAN**: Map out the logic. Identify root cause or required changes. Order changes by dependency.
3. **EXECUTE**: Fix the cause, not the symptom. Execute incrementally with clear commits.
4. **VERIFY**: Run ci checks and relevant smoke tests. Confirm the fix via logs or output.
5. **SPECIFICITY**: Do exactly as much as asked; nothing more, nothing less.
6. **PROPAGATION**: Changes impact multiple files; propagate updates correctly.

## SUMMARY STANDARDS

- Summaries must be technical and granular.
- Include: [Files Changed], [Logic Altered], [Verification Method], [Residual Risks] (if no residual risks then say none).

## TOOLS

- Prefer built-in tools (grep, read_file, etc.) over manual workflows. Check tool availability before use.

## MEMORY SYSTEM

This project uses a two-layer memory system. You MUST follow these rules.

### Layer 1: File-system memory (.memory/)
- **On session start**: Read `.memory/context.md` `.memory/decisions.md` `.memory/preferences.md` to load project context.
- **On state change**: When a branch is created/merged, a decision is made, or project state changes — update the relevant `.memory/` file immediately.
- **On session end / pause**: Update `.memory/context.md` with current branch, active tasks, and any new decisions. Leave the project in a state another AI tool can resume.

### Layer 2: Mem0 global memory (via MCP tools)
- **On session start**: Call `search_memories` with `{"AND": [{"user_id": "mem0-mcp"}, {"metadata": {"project": "free-claude-code"}}]}` to load project-specific memories. Also search without project filter for global preferences.
- **When to write**: User explicitly asks to remember something OR a cross-project decision is made OR a global preference is stated.
- **Scoping**: Always include `metadata={"project": "free-claude-code"}` for project memories. Omit project filter for global preferences.
- **Granularity**: ~3-5 memories per session max. Don't pollute.
